# 8-Bit Legacy — Ecommerce Infrastructure Audit

**Date:** April 6, 2026
**Store:** 8bitlegacy.com (dpxzef-st.myshopify.com)
**Auditor:** Claude (automated)

---

## 1. Google Merchant Center + Shopping Feed

**Status: Configured — Pending Product Sync**

- Google & YouTube Shopify app is installed and connected to tristanaddi1@gmail.com.
- Google Merchant Center account **5296797260** is linked.
- Google Analytics property **G-09HMHWDE5K** is connected.
- Product feed sync was initiated. Products will take up to a few days to fully populate in Merchant Center.
- Free listings are enabled — products will appear in Google Shopping organic results once the feed is approved.

**Action needed:** Monitor Merchant Center over the next 48–72 hours to confirm products are approved and appearing in the feed. Check for any disapproved items.

## 2. Google Ads Connection

**Status: Requires Manual Resolution**

- The Google & YouTube Shopify app is connected to the **tristanaddi1@gmail.com** Google account.
- That account shows Google Ads account **438-063-8976** in the app dropdown, but this is not the target account.
- The target account **822-210-2291** (MCC 444-244-1892) referenced in `.env.local` and the dashboard is likely under **sideshowtristan@gmail.com**.
- Checking ads.google.com under tristanaddi1@gmail.com revealed only 3 cancelled Google Ads accounts — none matching either ID.

**Action needed (pick one):**
1. Log into ads.google.com with **sideshowtristan@gmail.com** and add **tristanaddi1@gmail.com** as an admin on account 822-210-2291. Then link it through the Shopify Google & YouTube app.
2. Alternatively, disconnect and reconnect the Google & YouTube app using sideshowtristan@gmail.com instead.

Performance Max campaign creation was skipped per your instructions — can be set up after the account is linked.

## 3. CIB Variant Inventory Fix

**Status: Script Ready — Needs to Be Run Locally**

- Confirmed the issue: all "Complete (CIB)" variants across the store show **0 inventory** / "SOLD OUT!" while "Game Only" variants show 10,000.
- Created fix script at **`scripts/fix-cib-inventory.py`** that:
  - Fetches all active products via Shopify Admin REST API
  - Identifies CIB variants (by title containing "cib" or "complete")
  - Sets their available quantity to 10,000 at the primary location
  - Supports `--dry-run` mode for preview
- The script could not be run from the sandbox due to proxy restrictions on outbound API calls.

**Action needed:** Run from your local machine:
```bash
cd ~/8bit-legacy
python3 scripts/fix-cib-inventory.py --dry-run   # Preview first
python3 scripts/fix-cib-inventory.py              # Apply changes
```

**Important:** See Task 7 below — the app token may need `write_inventory` scope added first.

## 4. Shopify Store Settings

**Status: Verified — All Good**

Reviewed in a previous pass. Key findings:
- **Payments:** Shopify Payments active (2.9% + $0.30, Basic plan)
- **Checkout:** Standard Shopify checkout configured
- **Shipping:** Free shipping over $50, standard rates configured
- **Taxes:** US tax collection enabled

No issues found.

---

## 5. Shop App / Sales Channels

**Status: Action Needed on Shop Channel**

- **Online Store** — Active and working
- **Google & YouTube** — Installed and connected (see Task 2 for Ads account issue)
- **Shop** — Shows "Action needed" badge. The store doesn't currently meet Shop's shopping requirements, likely because many CIB variants show as out of stock. Fixing the CIB inventory (Task 3) should resolve this.

**Action needed:** After running the CIB inventory fix, revisit the Shop sales channel to see if the requirements are now met.

---

## 6. SEO / Online Store Verification

**Status: Verified — Looking Good**

- **Homepage:** Loads correctly with 8-Bit Legacy branding, search bar, navigation (Nintendo, Sega, Sony, Xbox, Sale), console category carousel, newsletter popup, social proof notifications, and footer with social links.
- **Collection pages:** Verified Nintendo 3DS Games collection — 51 items, proper banner image, filter/sort options, grid/list view toggle, product images all loading.
- **Product detail pages:** Verified Fire Emblem: Awakening — product image loads, price ($44.46) displayed, "In Stock" badge, SKU shown, variant selector (Game Only / Complete CIB), Add to Cart + Buy with Shop Pay + Wishlist buttons, free shipping notice, trust badges (free shipping over $50, 24/7 service, secure payments, 10% off first order).
- **Announcement bar:** "1 YEAR WARRANTY On All Orders + 30 Day Guaranteed Return Policy!" — prominent and visible.

**Issue noted:** Complete (CIB) variant shows "SOLD OUT!" badge on product pages — will be fixed by Task 3.

## 7. Shopify App API Scopes

**Status: Likely Missing `write_inventory` — Needs Verification**

The "8-Bit Legacy Dashboard" app (unlisted, installed April 1) shows the following permission areas in the Shopify admin:

| Area | View | Edit | Details |
|------|------|------|---------|
| Products | Yes | Yes | Products, collections |
| Orders | Yes | Yes | Order fulfillments, all order history (60 days) |

**What's present:**
- `read_products` / `write_products` (covers products + collections)
- `read_orders` / `write_orders` (covers orders)
- `read_fulfillments` / `write_fulfillments` (listed under Orders as "Order fulfillments")

**What's likely missing:**
- **`read_inventory` / `write_inventory`** — There is no separate "Inventory" row in the permissions table. If these scopes were granted, Shopify would show "Products, collections, **inventory**" or a separate Inventory area.

This matters because:
- The CIB fix script calls `inventory_levels/set.json`, which requires `write_inventory`
- The dashboard's inventory sync and price-sync features need inventory access
- Without this scope, the access token `shpat_c111...` cannot modify inventory levels

**Action needed:**
1. Go to the **Shopify Partners dashboard** (partners.shopify.com) → Apps → 8-Bit Legacy Dashboard
2. Under **Configuration → Admin API access scopes**, add: `read_inventory`, `write_inventory`
3. Save, then **reinstall the app** on the store to get an updated token
4. Update the new access token in `dashboard/.env.local`
5. Then run the CIB fix script
